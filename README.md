## Introduction

The solution to the interview assignment

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/ichtrojan/carthook.git
```

```bash
cd carthook
```

* Install dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

* Duplicate `.env.example`

```

* Modify the database credentials in the `.env` file to suit what you have locally

* Run migrations and seeders

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

>**NOTE**<br/>
> DO NOT RUN SEEDERS

* Start Queue

```bash
php artisan queue:work database
```

* Run the scheduler

```bash
php artisan schedule:run
```

The scheduler has to be running in the background. On macOS/Unix you should add the following to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file.

```bash
function scheduler () {
    while :; do
        php artisan schedule:run
       echo "Sleeping 60 seconds..."
        sleep 60
    done
}
```

The run the `scheduler` command in terminal. This will run the Laravel Scheduler every 60 seconds.

## Usage

## Summary

### API Calls

The API calls to JSONPlaceholder are Scheduled Jobs that run Every 60 Seconds.

### Data Caching

On every successful API call, the data returned are stored in the Database and Cached to file for faster access. Ideally, I would have used Redis but choose to skip that to simplify the installation.

### Database Structure

![structure](https://res.cloudinary.com/ichtrojan/image/upload/v1590380793/carthook_ccpwvv.png)

### Initial Call

The first time an endpoint is being called, there is a 2 seconds delay to enable the Scheduled job to process the API call, cache and store to the database.
Subsequent calls to the API should be processed withing 80ms on average.
